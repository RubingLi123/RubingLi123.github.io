            <h3>Running</h3>
            <p>
            I completed my first New York City full marathon in November 2023. The most challenging section of the route was the Queensboro Bridge at mile 19, with its grueling 5-mile uphill climbâ€”a true test for a casual runner like me. I followed a popular marathon training <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training/marathon-training/">program</a>, which has since inspired me to pursue more serious running.

            <p>
                I recently visited one of the largest recommerce warehouses in San Francisco and was amazed to see the intricate processes behind recycling pre-owned items. Click <a href="/recommerce_visits/">here</a> to see more photos behind the scene!

            <h3>Classical Music</h3>
            <p>
                I am a fan of classical music and a classically trained violinist, appreciating each piece as a delicately crafted novel with a rich, layered structure. Last year, I had the unforgettable experience of attending a Rachmaninoff marathon, where Yuja Wang performed all five piano concertos in a single program!
