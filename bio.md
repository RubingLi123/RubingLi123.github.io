I am a PhD student at [New York University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/), working in the [Department of Technology, Operations, and Statistics](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept), advised by [Arun Sundararajan](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/arun-sundararajan). My research interests lie in the economic and technological aspects of information systems. I . . 

Previously, I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2020 with a master's degree in Statistics and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, where my thesis was on causal inference with unstructured data. 

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and read fiction.
