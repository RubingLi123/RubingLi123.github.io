        <p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, working in the <a
            href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept/">Department of Technology, Operations, and Statistics (TOPS)</a>, advised by Prof. <a
            href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/arun-sundararajan">Arun Sundararajan</a>. My research interests lie in the economic and technological aspects of information systems. I study emergent phenomena on two-sided digital platforms that uphold broader goals of society, with a focus on sustainability-driven innovations and information transparency. I also leverage design principles to build systems and frameworks to enhance trust and decision-making for business.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not doing research, I like to read fictions, climb mountains, play the violin, and run marathons occasionally <a href="https://rubingli123.github.io/misc/"> </a>.</p>
