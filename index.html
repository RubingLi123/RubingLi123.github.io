<p>
    I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in Information Systems at  <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/"> Stern School of Business </a>, New York University. 
    Previously, I received my BS in mathematics and MS in statistics from University of Minnesota. 
</p>

<p>
    My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of economic and technical aspects of technology, in particular, technology-enabled commerce. 
    Thus far, I have sought to answer questions like (1) How does technology-enabled two-sided platform policy change affect decision-making process from both sides?
    (2) How to leverage fine-grained unstructured data (e.g., GIS, text, image and video data) assisted with machine learning algorithms, to understand and optimize individual decison making?
