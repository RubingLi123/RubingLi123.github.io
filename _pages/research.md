* Predicting Consumer In-Store Purchase Using Real-Time Retail Video Analytics. (With Anindya Ghose, Kaiquan Xu and Beibei Li) 

<ins>[Abstract]</ins>  The proliferation of video data in retail marketing brings opportunities for researchers to study customer behavior with video analytical tools. The existing methods that researchers used for extracting information from video are not scalable nor automatic, and the emotional response of customers are not recorded properly from video data. Our study demonstrates how video can be used to understand customer behavior of multiple dimensions including emotional responses on a scalable basis. We extracted features on the customer demographics, appearance, emotion, and contextual dimensions of customer behavior from the video with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. Combining video and transaction data, we proposed a novel framework using machine learning and deep learning models to analyze retail video content and predict consumer purchase decision. Our findings complement the emerging literature that examines customer behavior by incorporating video data into analysis, reveal multi-dimensional drivers of purchase decision in a retail setting, and provide an implementable video analytics tool for marketers and practitioners.

Measuring Self-Disclosure Across Different Social Media Sites. (With Joao Sedoc) *In Progress* <br>
<ins>[Abstract]</ins>  We proposed multiple metrics to measure level of self-disclosure across different social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit by leveraging NLP tools. We then find the attrubuting factors of the difference.

Rarity, Trader Heterogeity and Pricing Power in an NFT Marketplace. (with Arun Sundararajan) *In Progress* <br>
<ins>[Abstract]</ins>  We study trading and pricing of the 10,000 NFTs in the Cryptopunks collection and 10,000 NFTs in the BAYC collections, the earliest NFT collections, using a data set containing every transaction associated with the collection since release. Focusing on activity in 2021, there are signs of both efficiency and inefficiency in the market. Using a model that controls for time trends and cryptocurrency exchange rate fluctuations, we examine whether features of NFTs with a higher level of rarityhave higher (hedonic) prices. We find model-free evidence of market power heterogeneity: although the 12,000 or so CryptoPunk sales in 2021 involved almost 5000 distinct trader wallets, the top 1% active wallets were involved in over 43% of all 2021 transactions, and the top 10% most active wallets were in over 85% of all transactions. Using We estimate the total stock of the two NFT collections in 2021, and contrast the value of the set of NFTs traded during different periods with those that have never been traded. We show that more consistent with a trader base who holds their assets in Ethereum rather than fiat currency.

The Rise of Recommerce. (with Arun Sundararajan) *In Progress* <br>
<ins>[Abstract]</ins>  The emergence of branded recommerce — digitally enabled and branded marketplaces that facilitate purchasing pre-owned items directly from a manufacturer’s ecommerce site — leads to new variants of classic economic and marketing questions relating to secondary markets. Such branded recommerce creates opportunities for greater sustainability and stronger brand experience control but may also increase cannibalization of the sales of new items. We model the effects that the sales of pre-owned items have on market segmentation and product durability choices for a monopolist facing heterogeneous customers, contrasting outcomes when the trade of pre-owned goods takes place through a third-party marketplace with outcomes under branded recommerce. Using a two-period model, we show that the direct revenue benefits of branded recommerce are not their primary source of value, and rather, there are three indirect effects that can be beneficial to both seller profits and sustainability. Product  durability increases, a seller finds it optimal to forgo marketplace fees altogether, and there are greater seller incentives to lower quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items. We describe work in progress that extends our two period model to an infinite horizon model with overlapping generations, work we expect will be complete by the summer of 2023. Our paper sheds new insight into this emerging phenomenon, underscoring its importance in aligning seller profits with sustainability goals.
